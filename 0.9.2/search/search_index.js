This is most likely not what you want since you want\n            most looks to define new materials instead of overriding existing\n            materials.\n\n            Usually this happens if your current scene loads an input asset\n            that already has the materials you're creating in your current\n            scene as well. For example, if you are loading the Asset that\n            contains the previously publish of your look without muting the\n            look layer. As such, Houdini sees the materials already exist and\n            will not make new definitions, but only write \"override changes\".\n            However, once your look publish would replace the previous one then\n            suddenly the materials would be missing and only specified as\n            overrides.\n\n            So, in most cases this is solved by Layer Muting upstream the\n            look layers of the loaded asset.\n\n            If for a specific case the materials already existing in the input\n            is correct then you can either specify new material names for what\n            you're creating in the current scene or disable this validation\n            if you are sure you want to write overrides in your look publish\n            instead of definitions.\n            \"\"\"\n        )\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"autoapi/client/ayon_houdini/plugins/publish/validate_usd_output_node.html","title":"validate_usd_output_node","text":""},{"location":"autoapi/client/ayon_houdini/plugins/publish/validate_usd_output_node.html#client.ayon_houdini.plugins.publish.validate_usd_output_node.ValidateUSDOutputNode","title":"<code>ValidateUSDOutputNode</code>","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>HoudiniInstancePlugin</code></p> <p>Validate the instance USD LOPs Output Node.</p> This will ensure <ul> <li>The LOP Path is set.</li> <li>The LOP Path refers to an existing object.</li> <li>The LOP Path node is a LOP node.</li> </ul> Source code in <code>client/ayon_houdini/plugins/publish/validate_usd_output_node.py</code> <pre><code>class ValidateUSDOutputNode(plugin.HoudiniInstancePlugin):\n    \"\"\"Validate the instance USD LOPs Output Node.\n\n    This will ensure:\n        -
