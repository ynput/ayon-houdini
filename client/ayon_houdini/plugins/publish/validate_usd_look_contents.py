            A look publish should usually only contain materials, material

            This validation invalidates any creation of:
            - Render Settings,
            - Lights,
            - Cameras,
            - Geometry (Meshes, Curves and other geometry types)

            To avoid writing out loaded geometry into the output make sure to
            add a Layer Break after loading all the content you do **not** want
            to save into the output file. Then your materials, material
            bindings and render geometry settings are overrides applied to the
            loaded content after the **Layer Break LOP** node.

            If you happen to write out additional data for the meshes via
            e.g. a SOP Modify make sure to import to LOPs only the relevant
            attributes, mark them as static attributes, static topology and
            set the Primitive Definitions to be Overlay instead of Defines.

            Currently, to avoid issues with referencing/payloading geometry
            from external files any references or payloads are also disallowed
            for looks.
