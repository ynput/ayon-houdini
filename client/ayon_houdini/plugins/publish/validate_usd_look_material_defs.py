            There are materials in your current look that do not **define** the
            material primitives, but rather **override** or specify a
            **class**. This is most likely not what you want since you want
            most looks to define new materials instead of overriding existing
            materials.

            Usually this happens if your current scene loads an input asset
            that already has the materials you're creating in your current
            scene as well. For example, if you are loading the Asset that
            contains the previously publish of your look without muting the
            look layer. As such, Houdini sees the materials already exist and
            will not make new definitions, but only write "override changes".
            However, once your look publish would replace the previous one then
            suddenly the materials would be missing and only specified as
            overrides.

            So, in most cases this is solved by Layer Muting upstream the
            look layers of the loaded asset.

            If for a specific case the materials already existing in the input
            is correct then you can either specify new material names for what
            you're creating in the current scene or disable this validation
            if you are sure you want to write overrides in your look publish
            instead of definitions.
